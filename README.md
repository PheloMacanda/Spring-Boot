# Spring-Boot

# In this Spring-Boot folder, there are two folders namely, SpringBoot Java and Spring-BootApp Angular

# On the SpringBoot Java folder there is a Maven project which has 3 folders and pom.xml file

# On the src folder you go to main/java/com/phelo/springboot, there are two classes Converter.java and ConvertMain.java

# Assess the Converter.java it has comments and methods for conversions, since I could not find the restful api's.

# The test class is on the test folder in src and is written on JUnit


# The second folder which is Spring-BootApp Angular

# This folder contains all the relevant folders/scripts/files for my app

# Go to Spring-BootApp Angular/src/app to find the basic html file I have created for the app, it is called app.component

# Open it on your browser to see how it looks like, this does nothing because I have failed to map my java maven code to angular
